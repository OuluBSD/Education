# L01 Bullet Plan

## Main Topics

**Topic 1: Digital Audio Fundamentals & Reason Setup**
- Understanding audio vs. MIDI signals
- Reason interface overview (Rack, Sequencer, Mixer)
- Create new project; set tempo and grid

**Topic 2: Introduction to Synthesis - Piano/Chords First**
- Piano roll grid system and note placement
- Basic chord theory (major/minor triads)
- Record or draw piano motif; quantize lightly

**Topic 3: Rhythm and Drum Programming**
- Basic drum patterns (kick, snare, hi-hat)
- Using Redrum drum machine

**Topic 4: Bass and Sound Design with Synthesizers**
- Subtractive synthesis fundamentals
- Bass line creation to complement piano and drums

**Topic 5: Mixing and Effects**
- Level balancing between piano, drums, and bass
- Introduction to reverb and time-based effects

**Topic 6: Arrangement and Export**
- Song structure basics
- Export WAV; name `L01_loop_v01.wav`

## Extra Material: Synth ADSR Envelope and Samples (If we go too fast)

### ADSR Envelope Details:
**Attack Knob:** Controls how fast the sound reaches its peak volume
- Turn counter-clockwise: Instant attack (percussive)
- Turn clockwise: Gradual attack (pad-like, warm)

**Decay Knob:** Controls how fast the sound drops from peak to Sustain level
- Turn counter-clockwise: Fast drop to sustain
- Turn clockwise: Slow drop to sustain

**Sustain Knob:** Controls the volume level for as long as you hold the note
- Turn counter-clockwise: Quieter sustain level
- Turn clockwise: Louder sustain level

**Release Knob:** Controls how fast the sound fades out after releasing the note
- Turn counter-clockwise: Sound stops quickly after releasing
- Turn clockwise: Sound fades out slowly after releasing

### Sample vs Synthesized Sound:
**Samples:** Pre-recorded audio of real instruments (piano, strings, drums, etc.)
- Pros: Rich, authentic sound
- Cons: Larger file size, less manipulation options

**Synthesized Sounds:** Electronically generated sounds (Subtractor synth)
- Pros: Small file size, highly adjustable, infinite variations
- Cons: May sound less natural than samples
