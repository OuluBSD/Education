## Timeline Structure (Total: 75 minutes)
- **0:00 - 0:10** - History intro (using intro presentation) 
- **0:10 - 0:15** - Demo song listening and goal setting
- **0:15 - 0:25** - Project setup and instrument addition
- **0:25 - 0:40** - Piano/chord creation and arrangement
- **0:40 - 0:55** - Effects, routing, and drums

## Step 1: History Introduction (10 minutes)
- Show intro presentation slides about music production history
- Explain how we got to Propellerheads Reason in 2002
- Transition to today's session

## Step 2: Demo Song Listening (5 minutes)
- Play the pre-made demo song
- Explain this is the target we'll build together
- Outline the structure: piano, drums, bass

## Step 3: Project Setup (10 minutes)
**Teacher Demonstration (2 min):**
- Open empty project in Reason 2.5
- Add main mixer to rack
- Show how to add instruments to rack

**Student Activity (8 min):**
- Student follows on her computer
- Teacher circulates to provide individual help
- Add first instrument (NN-XT) with specified preset

## Step 4: Piano/Chord Creation (15 minutes)
**Teacher Demonstration (3 min):**
- Add first note to piano roll
- Create a simple chord from that note
- Show how to copy-paste chord with Ctrl+drag
- Demonstrate changing individual notes to create different chords

**Student Activity (12 min):**
- Student creates basic chord pattern
- Copy and vary chords to create 8 bars
- Teacher circulates to help as needed
- Find better preset for more pleasant sound

## Step 5: Effects and Drums (15 minutes)
**Teacher Demonstration (4 min):**
- Add effect to piano track (reverb or delay)
- Explain virtual routing concept with cables
- Add drum machine (Redrum)
- Create basic 4/4 beat (kick on 1&3, snare on 2&4)

**Student Activity (11 min):**
- Student adds effect to own piano track
- Connect devices with virtual cables
- Create basic drum pattern matching piano
- Teacher provides assistance as needed

## Step 6: Bass Addition (15 minutes)
**Teacher Demonstration (3 min):**
- Add bass synth (Subtractor)
- Create simple bass line that follows chord roots
- Demonstrate basic ADSR settings for warm bass tone

**Student Activity (12 min):**
- Student adds bass track
- Create bass line that complements piano and drums
- Adjust ADSR settings for desired tone
- Balance levels between all three elements

## Step 7: Final Touches (5 minutes)
**Together:**
- Balance levels in mixer
- Listen to entire composition
- Export as WAV file
- Review what was accomplished

## Step 8: Lesson Ending and Next Steps (10 minutes)
**To discuss:**
- Review the loop created together
- Provide feedback on student's progress
- Discuss practice time recommendations (15-30 mins between lessons)
- Address any remaining questions

**Laptop Loan:**
- Explain laptop return policy (to be determined)
- Demonstrate how to save projects properly
- Provide basic troubleshooting tips for common issues
- Set expectations for independent practice

**Payment Discussion:**
- Mention that lessons are 30-50€ per session
- Explain reasoning for lower rate (new teacher, feedback welcome)
- Discuss payment schedule (per lesson or package options)
- Confirm next lesson scheduling if interested

## Teacher Circulation Strategy:
- Demonstrate technique clearly on teacher computer first
- Allow 2-3 minutes for independent student work
- Circulate to observe and identify students who need help
- Provide direct instruction only to those who are stuck
- Use visual cues to determine who needs help vs. who is progressing

## Timeout Rules:
- If any step exceeds 150% of allocated time, use "bookmark timeout"
- Acknowledge progress and move to next step
- Mark challenging areas to revisit in future lessons
- Use phrases: "This is important but let's continue and return to details later"

## Backup Plans:
- If piano creation goes too fast: Add more chord variations
- If drums go too fast: Add fills or percussion elements
- If bass goes too fast: More ADSR exploration or additional effects
