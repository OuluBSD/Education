# L07 Bullet Plan

- Static mix: faders/pans only; no plugins
- Subtractive EQ: high-pass non-bass; tame harsh bands
- Compression: slow attack on drums/bus; -2 to -4 dB GR
- Reverb/delay via sends; keep returns low and in tempo
- Vocal rides: automate phrases to sit consistently
- Export stereo and mono versions
