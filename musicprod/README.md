Music Production Syllabus (10 Lessons)

Context
- Teacher: Pro producer, new to teaching; student is older and a professional school teacher.
- Student: Strong pianist, comfortable reading/writing piano scores; complete beginner in DAWs/production.
- Gear: Two Windows Vista–era laptops; Propellerhead Reason v2.5; Steinberg Cubase 5; broad set of VSTs (synths, samplers, drums, FX); target quick path to vocal tuning by Lesson 4.
- Approach: Start in Reason (all-in-one, stable on old HW), then bridge to Cubase + VST workflow. Emphasize hands-on, block‑based sequencing and quick wins.

Structure
- 10 lessons, 90 minutes each (suggested). Each lesson has: Objectives, Core Topics, Hands‑On, Homework, and Quick Teacher Tips.
- Keep sessions practical; use student’s piano strength for fast arrangement building.
- Save versions often; name projects clearly with L## prefixes.

Lesson 1 — Setup, Signal Flow, and Blocks in Reason
Objectives
- Understand DAW basics, Reason rack, sequencer lanes, transport, metronome, and block/pattern writing.
- Create first 8–16 bar loop using Reason stock devices only.
Core Topics
- Audio vs. MIDI, sample rate, latency basics; Reason rack signal flow (mixer → devices → master); browser; sequencer tools; quantize.
Hands‑On
- New project: tempo, grid, click. Add Redrum/Subtractor/NN-XT. Pencil in drums and bass via blocks. Record or draw a simple piano motif. Basic mixer balance and gentle reverb.
Homework
- Expand loop to A–B sections (16–32 bars). Export WAV.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Keep it simple; avoid deep menus. Use block drawing for speed. Validate audio device/latency early.

Lesson 2 — Rhythm, Arrangement, and Templates
Objectives
- Build a reusable song template; arrange intro/verse/chorus quickly.
Core Topics
- Drum programming, ghost notes, humanize vs. quantize; duplicating blocks; mixer groups.
Hands‑On
- Create template with mixer, Redrum, Subtractor, NN-XT, reverb, delay, master limiter. Arrange 60–90s sketch with A–B–A–C.
Homework
- Draft a 2-minute piano-led cue using the template.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Demonstrate one pattern, then have student replicate immediately.

Lesson 3 — Sound Design Basics and Layering
Objectives
- Use stock subtractive synth and sampler to layer sounds; apply basic EQ/compression.
Core Topics
- ADSR, filters, LFOs; NN-XT sample mapping basics; subtractive layers; EQ carve; bus compression.
Hands‑On
- Layer bass (Subtractor) + piano (NN-XT) + pad; EQ overlapping ranges; gentle bus comp.
Homework
- Recreate one favorite song section with layered instruments.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Keep one tweak per parameter at a time; A/B often.

Lesson 4 — Intro to Vocals and Pitch Correction (Goal: early AutoTune)
Objectives
- Record/import a vocal and apply pitch correction using available tools.
Core Topics
- Microphone chain basics; gain staging; comping; pitch correction concepts (retune speed, scale, formant).
Hands‑On
- If Reason: record/import vocal; basic comp. Then move to Cubase 5; insert generic “Pitch Correction” VST on vocal insert; set key/scale, retune speed; explore gentle vs. effect settings.
Homework
- Record 30–60s vocal phrase; practice subtle vs. hard-tune settings; export A/B.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Prioritize musical scale/key selection; avoid overdriving inputs; use conservative monitoring levels.

Lesson 5 — Transition to Cubase 5 + VST Workflow
Objectives
- Recreate Lesson 2 template in Cubase; route VST instruments and FX; understand inserts vs. sends.
Core Topics
- Project setup, devices/VST connections; instrument tracks vs. MIDI + rack; send FX; freezing tracks on old hardware.
Hands‑On
- Build Cubase template (drums, bass, keys, pad, two audio tracks, reverb send, delay send, master bus).
Homework
- Rebuild earlier Reason sketch in Cubase; bounce stems if needed.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Show Freeze early to manage CPU; keep buffer size higher when mixing.

Lesson 6 — Editing, Timing, and Comping
Objectives
- Master MIDI and audio editing, quantize, swing, and comping takes.
Core Topics
- MIDI editor tools; audio slice/nudge; crossfades; comp lanes; timing vs. feel.
Hands‑On
- Tighten drums/bass; comp a short vocal; apply light de-essing/EQ.
Homework
- Deliver a 60–90s polished section with tight timing and a comped vocal.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Save alternates; avoid destructive edits; teach “Ctrl+Z discipline.”

Lesson 7 — Mixing Fundamentals on Limited Hardware
Objectives
- Balance, pan, EQ, compression, reverb/delay; reference tracks; headroom.
Core Topics
- Gain staging to -6 dBFS peak; high-pass filtering; masking; mono checks; reference matching by ear.
Hands‑On
- Static mix → subtractive EQ → gentle compression → space via sends; automate vocal rides.
Homework
- Mix the Lesson 6 project to a listenable WAV; include a mono export for checks.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Use few, familiar plugins; resist “plugin hopping.”

Lesson 8 — Creative FX, Automation, and Arrangement Development
Objectives
- Use modulation/delay/reverb creatively; automate energy; build transitions.
Core Topics
- Chorus/flanger/phasor; tape delay; filter sweeps; risers/falls via automation; stutters by slicing.
Hands‑On
- Add two tasteful FX moves and two transitions to current project; automate a chorus lift.
Homework
- Extend arrangement to 2–3 minutes; mark section changes clearly.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Keep FX in tempo; automate mix levels for clarity.

Lesson 9 — Finalizing: Export, Stems, and Basic Mastering
Objectives
- Export mix and stems; apply simple master chain; loudness considerations for older tools.
Core Topics
- Dithering; brickwall limiting; EQ tilt; referencing; naming conventions for stems.
Hands‑On
- Create a light mastering chain (EQ → compressor → limiter); export full mix and stems.
Homework
- Prepare a final candidate and one alternate master (softer limiting).
Quick Teacher Tips
- Preserve dynamics; avoid chasing loudness on old hardware.

Lesson 10 — Capstone and Review
Objectives
- Complete a full short track from idea to master using either Reason or Cubase.
Core Topics
- Workflow review; template hygiene; backup; next steps: collaboration, vocal sessions, genre explorations.
Hands‑On
- 60-minute build/sprint + 30-minute review and notes.
Homework
- None; optional: start a new piece with the template.
Quick Teacher Tips
- Focus on strengths (piano-driven arrangements); leave a clear next-project checklist.

Practice & Assessment
- Each lesson produces a tangible export (WAV/MP3). Keep a folder per lesson: L01_..., L02_... etc.
- Quick formative checks: 5-minute “teach-back” where student explains one tool/step.
- Summative: Capstone track meeting a simple rubric (arrangement, timing, mix clarity, vocal tuning usage).

Old Hardware Strategy
- Prefer Reason for stability; move to Cubase when VSTs or vocal tools are needed.
- Use Freeze/Bounce-in-place; commit early; keep sessions lean; avoid heavy visualizers.

Plugin Classifications (generic placeholders)
- Instruments: Synth (subtractive, FM), Sampler, Drum Machine, Electric Piano, Organ.
- FX: EQ (clean, analog-style), Compressor (VCA/Opto), Limiter, Saturation, Chorus/Flanger/Phaser, Delay (tape/digital), Reverb (plate/room), De-esser, Pitch Correction.

Versioning & Files
- Create per-lesson project folders: musicprod/L##/project_files and exports in musicprod/L##/exports.
- Save iterative versions: Project_L##_v01, v02, etc.

Project File Placement (Manual Steps)
- For each lesson, save DAW sessions in `musicprod/L##/project_files/`.
- Place audio exports (mixes, stems) in `musicprod/L##/exports/`.
- Keep Git clean: `.gitignore` already excludes common DAW binaries and exports.

If a folder is missing, create it before saving. Example:
- L04: `musicprod/L04/project_files/L04_VocalTuning_v01.cpr`
- L04: `musicprod/L04/exports/L04_vox_subtle_v01.wav`
