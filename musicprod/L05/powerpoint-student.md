# L05 Deck — Cubase + VSTs

Slide 1 — Why Cubase Now?
- VSTs and vocal tools need it; template mirrors Reason.

Image Prompt
- “DAW mixer with labeled sends/inserts, clean schematic.”

Slide 2 — Inserts vs. Sends
- Inserts shape the track; sends add shared space.

Image Prompt
- “Two panels showing insert chain vs. reverb send bus, simple graphics.”

Slide 3 — Freeze to Save CPU
- Freeze prints audio; unfreeze to edit.

Image Prompt
- “Snowflake icon over a CPU chip, friendly flat design.”
