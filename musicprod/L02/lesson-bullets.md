# L02 Bullet Plan

- Load L01 or start new; set up sends (reverb/delay)
- Create drum variations: ghost notes, off-hats, fills
- Duplicate 8-bar blocks to A–B–A–C form (60–90s)
- Save as `Reason_Template.rns` with core devices
- Balance levels; check mono and headroom (-6 dBFS)
- Export `L02_sketch_v01.wav`
